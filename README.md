The Simulator allows to study dynamical systems
like growth models, billiard, coupled pendulums,
iterations in the complex plane.
The mathematics behind is documented in German
and English. See "Dynamische Systeme" or "Dynamic Systems"
in the main folders.
The code is public and feedbacks are welcome to
h.biner@bluewin.ch.

The Simulator allows to study dynamical systems
like growth models, billiard, coupled pendulums,
iterations in the complex plane.

The mathematics behind is documented in German
and English. See "Dynamische Systeme" or "Dynamic Systems"
in the folder Simulator/Documentation. 
There is also the technical documentation
and the user manual in G/E.

If you just need the MSI installer for the Simulator
see the Release Tab on the right side. Because the
setup-file is not downloaded often, there will 
a security warning show up. You can ignore it.

The code is public and feedbacks are welcome to
h.biner@bluewin.ch.
